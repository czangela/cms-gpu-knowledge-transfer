# Archived resources

I wasn't sure how to start knowledge transfer.

In this previous approach I started creating a course to cover `CUDA` basics and make the reader familiar with `CMSSW`.

<!-- It was the wrong approach.

No one told me so, not because they didn't see what I was doing, but because they didn't know what I should be doing.

It is hard when there is no management or the management doesn't know what should happen. One could argue that the two are the same.

So I won't be the one creating already available content for some people not doing their part of the work using already existing resources.  -->
